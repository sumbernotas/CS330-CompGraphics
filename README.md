*CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization* @ SNHU, September-Pctober 2024 w/ Professor Eugenio Rodriguez

This course teaches how to create interactive, three-dimensional objects throug hthe use of API libraries and best practices. We qere required to develop fully formed graphic applications that meet the given requirements.


# Project Requirements
You work as a C++ and OpenGL 3D graphics developer for Triangle and Cube Studios. This company designs 3D worlds for clients and customizes them based on the varied needs presented by each particular client

you must address the following rubric criteria:

## 3D Objects

Create low-polygon 3D representations of real-world objects. Make sure you have at least four completed objects in your 3D scene. At least one of the objects you create should be made using two or more primitive shapes. Note that the object you completed in an earlier milestone can count as one of your four. Use organized geometry and make sure that the polygons (triangles) on each 3D model are well spaced and connected. Minimize complexity and save 3D modeling time by setting the polygon count for your objects under 1,000 triangles. Remember to think in terms of simple shapes and ask yourself what basic 3D shapes go into making up each object in your scene. Four of the following basic shapes must appear at least once in your creation:

Box

Cone

Cylinder

Plane

Prism

Pyramid

Sphere

Tapered cylinder

Torus

### Apply accurately projected textures to a 3D model.
You must select at least two objects to texture. Note that you should have already textured one object in a previous milestone. If you use that object here, it will count as one of your two. The textures you select should be royalty-free images with resolutions of 1024 by 1024 pixels or higher. Please refer to the Sourcing Textures Tutorial linked in the Supporting Materials section for help finding images that you can use for textures.

### Apply lighting to create a polished visualization of 3D models. 
You must include a minimum of two light sources, and at least one of them should be colored. Note that the light you worked on in a previous milestone counts as one of your two lights. The light sources you create will need to capture all of the objects in the 3D world you are building. They should be positioned at locations that do not cause parts of the objects to appear dark when moving the camera around them. Include a point light for one of your two lights. You may use a directional light or spotlight. Make sure that you design lights in a way that helps create a final polished presentation. Use all components of the Phong shading model, including the following components:

Ambient

Diffuse

Specular

### Place objects appropriately, using the X, Y, and Z coordinates, relative to one another in the 3D world. 
Match the photograph you selected as closely as possible by placing the objects in their proper locations. Note: The objects may overlap because all of the objects were likely initially placed at 0, 0, 0.

## Navigation

### Apply horizontal, vertical, and depth camera navigation around the 3D scene. 
The camera will be traversing the X, Y, and Z axes. Make sure it captures all of the objects in your 3D scene. Use the code you created in an earlier milestone and then increase the radius of the cameraâ€™s orbit so it will project light on all of the objects. Add each object separately and then adjust the orbit radius or position of the camera each time. Use the following input devices:
WASD keys should be used to control the forward, backward, left, and right motion.
QE keys should be used to control the upward and downward movement.

### Apply nuanced camera controls to effectively view the 3D objects in the application. 
Changing the camera controls should allow the orientation of the camera to change even though its location has not moved. Focus first on pitch and yaw, but careful changes can be made to roll. Code for adjustments in the speed of the movement. This way, a user will have more control over how they explore the objects in the scene. Use the following input devices:
Mouse cursor should be used to change the orientation of the camera so it can look up and down or right and left.
Mouse scroll should be used to adjust the speed of the movement or the speed at which camera travels around the scene.

### Create perspective and orthographic displays of the 3D world. 
Use the tap of a keyboard key to allow a user to change the viewport display of all objects in the scene between orthographic (2D) and perspective (3D) views. Switch the function call to retrieve either the perspective or orthographic projection matrix. Keep the camera in the same orientation.

## Best Practices

### Apply coding best practices in formatting, commenting, and functional logic. Complete the following items:
Employ formatting best practices by providing program code that is easy to read and follows industry standard code formatting practices, such as indentation and spacing.
Employ commenting best practices to ensure project source code is briefly and clearly explained using descriptive comments.
Employ functional coding logic best practices to ensure the program runs as expected. You do not have to include Note that not everything should be written in a single function. Your work should be well modularized.

# Reflection

## How do I approach designing and developing software?
My first step to designing and/or developing software is collecting all of the requirements and ensuring I understand what is being asked from me. From there, I will go ahead and plan out how I intend to set up the basis of my project, what language, IDE, how things will be implemented, etc. These are the first two steps to approaching any software. 

With the project that I did in this class, I was able to get experience reading someone else's code and implementing my own work into it. This has helped me better grasp the concept of taking code and transforming it into soemthing that meets requirements wether thats in a whole or through milestones.
